Once upon a time, a beautiful young girl named Cinderella lived with her wicked stepmother and two selfish stepsisters. Since her father passed away, Cinderella had been the one who worked the hardest and was always the last one standing.

One day, news came that a grand festival was to be held at the royal palace. All the young men and women were invited as the prince was looking for a bride.

Cinderella's stepmother and stepsisters were excited and prepared special clothes and shoes for the event. Cinderella too wanted to attend the festival, but her stepmother gave her chores and refused to allow her to go.

On the day of the festival, Cinderella was left alone at home, submerged in sadness. Then, suddenly, her fairy godmother appeared and granted Cinderella's wish.

The fairy godmother transformed a pumpkin, two mice, and a lizard into a golden carriage, horsemen, and a charming coachman with her magic. She also turned Cinderella's old clothes into a gorgeous and beautiful dress.

However, the godmother warned, "You must return before midnight. After that time, everything will revert to its original state."

Keeping that in mind, Cinderella attended the festival, captivating everyone with her beauty. The prince danced with Cinderella, and she was equally smitten with him.

However, as time passed and midnight approached, Cinderella had to leave the palace in a hurry. In her rush, she dropped one of her glass slippers on the staircase.

The next day, the prince searched the entire kingdom to find the owner of the glass slipper. The slipper didn't fit any of the women, but it fit Cinderella perfectly.

Thus, Cinderella married the prince, and they lived happily ever after. And Cinderella's stepmother and stepsisters eventually learned from her kind heart.
