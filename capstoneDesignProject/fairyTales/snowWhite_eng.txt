Once upon a time, in a distant small kingdom, there lived a beautiful queen. This queen had a lovely and virtuous daughter as beautiful as her name, Snow White. Snow White had skin as white as snow and hair as black as ebony.

However, one day the queen passed away, and the king took a new queen. The new queen was beautiful, but she was arrogant and had a wicked heart. She prided herself on being the most beautiful woman in the world.

The new queen always asked her magic mirror, "Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who in this land is fairest of all?" And the magic mirror always answered, "You are the fairest of all."

But as time passed, Snow White grew more beautiful. As she matured, she became even more stunning, and one day when the queen asked the same question to the mirror, it answered, "You are very beautiful, but Snow White is the fairest of all."

The queen was deeply shocked by these words. She became jealous of Snow White and began to harbor evil thoughts of getting rid of her.

The queen called a huntsman and ordered him to take Snow White into the woods and kill her. But the huntsman, moved by Snow White's beauty and innocence, spared her life and instead showed the queen the heart of a wild boar he had caught in the mountain as proof.

Snow White was left alone in the forest and, terrified, she ran until she found a small cottage. The cottage was inhabited by dwarfs. Snow White asked the dwarfs if she could hide with them, and they accepted her request.

Meanwhile, when the queen asked the magic mirror again, she heard that Snow White was still the fairest of all. The queen was infuriated and set out to find Snow White.

The queen tried to kill Snow White twice by deception but, with the help of the dwarfs, Snow White managed to escape each crisis. However, the third time, the queen tricked Snow White with a poisoned apple, and Snow White fell after eating it.

The dwarfs, overcome with sorrow, laid Snow White in a glass coffin. Then one day, a prince passing by discovered the glass coffin and kissed Snow White. At that moment, Snow White woke up, and the two got married and lived happily ever after. And the wicked queen received her punishment for her evil deeds.
